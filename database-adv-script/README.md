# Complex SQL Queries with Joins

##  Objective
Master SQL joins by writing complex queries using different types of joins.


## Overview

Retrieves all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.

### 2. LEFT JOIN — Properties with their Reviews
Retrieves all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.

### 3. FULL OUTER JOIN — All Users and Bookings
Retrieves all users and all bookings, even if not linked together.
